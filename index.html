    <section class="AboutMe">
        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>From my time as a Staff Sergeant in the United States Air Force, where I worked as a flightline mechanic,
            to my transition as a full-stack developer, I have acquired a diverse range of skills and experiences. I
            have expertise in Java, Spring, front-end languages like React, and SQL.
            My military background has instilled in me discipline,
            a strong work ethic, and the ability to excel under pressure. I am eager to contribute my technical skills,
            problem-solving mindset, and collaborative approach to drive
            innovation and make a meaningful impact as a full-stack developer.
